# Apple News Core Enhancements
Core enhancements to the [`Publish to Apple News`](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/publish-to-apple-news/) plugin by Alley Interactive

# Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MailOnline/mdt-apple-news-core-enhancements/releases/latest) and include it within your plugins folder and enable as normal. This plugin has a dependency on the [`Publish to Apple News`](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/) plugin and will do nothing if it isn't also enabled on the same WordPress install.

This plugin has no settings within the Admin.

# Enhancements
- TikTok component.
- Publish to Apple News toggle button in Gutenberg editor.
- Auto retry publishing and updating of Apple News articles to prevent updates getting stuck in pending in the WordPress admin.
- Removes all empty components from article.json to prevent validation errors.
- Increase timeout for api requests to Apple News.
- Adds Apple News status column to the manage posts view.
- Hide all notices generated by the `Publish to Apple News` plugin.
- Optionally routes all hidden notices to a slack channel through a given webhook endpoint.
- Strips broken links from post_content to prevent article rejection when publishing
